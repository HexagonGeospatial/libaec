============
Installation
============

The most common installation procedure looks as follows.

Unpack the tar archive and change into the unpacked directory.

  ./configure
  make check install


=======================
Intel compiler settings
=======================

The Intel compiler can improve performance by vectorizing certain
parts of the code on x86 architectures. Assuming your CPU supports
AVX2, the following options will increase encoding speed.

  ./configure CC=icc
  make CFLAGS="-O3 -xCORE-AVX2" bench

On a 3.4 GHz E3-1240 v3 we see more than 400 MiB/s for encoding
typical data.

Using other SIMD instruction sets on older CPUs may also help.
